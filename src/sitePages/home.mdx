Welcome to physref, an [open-source](https://github.com/R2B1) physics formulary.

*Please note that this project isn't quite ready for consumption yet. The formulary is mostly barren and some aspects of the site may be a bit rough around the edges.*

If you'd like to help out, see [How to contribute to the formulary](http://physref.com/contribute).

To see what it's all [about](http://physref.com/about), check out this [example formulary page](http://physref.com/Classical-Mechanics/Central-forces/).
